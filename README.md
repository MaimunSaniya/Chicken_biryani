***Maimun Saniya's Chicken biryani recipe***

Traditional Chicken biryani is made by layering marinated chicken and then layered with parboiled rice, herbs & then oil. I have shared that traditional HYDRABADI BIRYANI HERE.

This recipe yields a **chicken biryani** that isn't too oily, spicy, hot or pungent. This is best served with a RAITA. : )# Chicken_biryani
